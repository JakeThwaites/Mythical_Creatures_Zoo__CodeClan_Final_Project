# Mythical_Creatures_Zoo__CodeClan_Final_Project

TODO:

Create option for creatures to kill a random visitor to the menagerie
Add images for creatures

BRIEF:

Goal: Create a web application in React with Spring/Java back end

You have been asked to create a web app to allow the management of a mythical creature park to manage the dinosaur population and visitor tracking of the Park. (No expense spared)

MVP
The user must be able to add paddocks, add / remove creatures to paddocks, feed creatures. You should also be able to transfer Herbivores between paddocks. :/

Project Extensions
Creatures can randomly rampage and break out of their paddocks. The system should lock down until all creatures are wrangled. (timeout?)
Visitors can enter / exit the park if the creatures are not rampaging.
View the number of visitors in the park at a given time.
Anything else you can dream up!
